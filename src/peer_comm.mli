type t 

(** We suppose that the connection is already established and we have a reader
    and a writer to communicate with the peer. The address is only used to 
    identify the peer in debug traces.

    We distinguish between the peers that initiate the connexion (when our
    peer is listening to incoming connexion), and those that we contact
    from the tracker's list of peer. This makes only a difference in the 
    handshake. *)

(** [handshake x info_hash pid] initiates the pwt protocol with peer [x].

    It consists in a round-trip message of the form.
       fixed_prefix ^ info_hash ^ pid

    The connecting peer is the one initiating the connexion. Both info_hash
    must match. Each peer sends its peer_id, that should match the one returned
    by the tracker (if any... apparently there's none in compact form which
    is the one we're using). 

    As a side effect, we save the peer_id *)

    info_hash the peer wants to download (it's announced in the handshake.
     We validate the handshake only if we serve this info_hash *)
