(** Entry point to the project. It implements the command-line options and 
    run the various stages. So far, it includes:
      - decoding bencoded torrent file
      - querying the tracker to retrieve list of peers
      - initiating the P2P protocol with one of the peers.

    All this project makes use of [Core], [Async] and [Log.Global]. *)
