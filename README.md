# OCaml-torrent (work in progress)

This is a toy bittorrent client. My goal was to familializing myself with `Core` and `Async` APIs. The aim is to be able to download most type of torrent files from the command line with acceptable performance, and a code clean and documented enough so it can be useful for someone else.

### Usage

You will need to install some external libraries with `opam` (notably `core`, `async`, `cohttp`, `bencode`, `sha`, `uri`).

Compile with `make` then run `./main.byte FILE` to start the program. `FILE` is a torrent file. (e.g. `ubuntu-17.04-desktop-amd64.iso.torrent`).

### How does it work?

This my current understanding of the protocol and is subject to change!

A bittorrent file is encoded as [bencode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bencode). First step is to decode the torrent file (we use the `bencode` library) and extract the relevant information (including the server `tracker` URL). Next step is to http-query the tracker to retrieve the list of peers sharing (parts of) the file. One important parameter of the query is the 20-bytes string `sha1` value of the info section of the torrent file. This will identify the file in subsequent queries.

Once we know the list of peers, we'll talk with each of them using a binary protocol. This is done in two steps.
 * an initial handshake (one round-trip message exchange)
 * then (binary asynchronous) messages to get parts of the file.

Current stage of the project: 
 * both single-file format and multiple-file format are correctly read
 * annouce-list is (partialy) supported
 * several peers can be queried concurrently
 * The handshake is functional (in `App_layer`).
 * Binary messages are implemented (via serialization of `Message.t`). 
 * Per-peer state (including socket read/write, choked, interested status...) is maintained in `Peer`.
 * A `File.t` is divided in `Piece.t`. Each `Piece.t` is furthermore divided in blocks (Bitset.t describes the blocks of a piece already downloaded). 
 * In the application layer `App_layer`, after the handshake, several services are launched. 
 * One continuously wait for peer messages (block of files, information on pieces ownership, request to download...). 
 * Another one requests for pieces. At the moment, only peers that are not choking with less than a few pending request are considered. Among them, we ask for pieces that not yet requested or downloaded without any particular strategy.
* Requests that have been pending for n seconds are canceled. 
* File/Bitset is saved to disk on exit (termination signal) and restored at startup

This works for simple cases. It is possible to download a single file torrent but a lot remains to be done. 
* multifile torrent
* deal correctly with requests from peers (interested/choked msg)
* server mode when using public IP 
* re-query trackers if needed (dynamic set of peers)
* more testing + corner cases (corrupted persistent states, malicious peers)
* Improve requesting strategy (e.g. rare pieces first, peer responsivness, event-based instead of polling)
* doc
* automatic testing

Morever, the code can be improved.
* better resource management (buffers, close connections...)
* Use more efficient datastructures
* Rework the module interfaces. There are invariant that span several modules that should be identified and if possible encapsulated.
