# Ocaml-torrent

Simple torrent client. This is a simple project for the sake of familializing
myself with OCaml Core and torrent/magnet protocol. Not intended to be usable 
although I expect that it will download torrent files eventually.

### Usage

        make

expected behavior `./main.native torrent-uri` downloads torrent file.
