# Jbuiler/merlin integration

Merlin doesn't understand jbuilder generated .merlin files. The problem is
fixed by pinning some packages to their latest development version. Jbuilder
is pinned to 1.0+beta11 (not the latest version) as package bin_prot doesn't 
compile with jbuilder 1.0+beta12. 

core                     v0.9.115.06+117 (pinned) 
jbuilder                      1.0+beta11 (pinned)
merlin                             3.0.2 (pinned)
ocaml-migrate-parsetree            1.0.3 (pinned)

In addition, packages starting with 'ppx_' should be manually removed from the
.merlin files.

# UDP bug 

Async/UDP doesn't work on Mac OS.
https://discuss.ocaml.org/t/sending-udp-on-macos-fails/636

This has been fixed by a pull request but not yet integrated into the latest 
release.

These libraries are upded frequently, so I assume this to be solved very quicky.
