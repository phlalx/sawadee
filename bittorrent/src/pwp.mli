(** Peer wire protocol. 

    This central module is responsible of sharing data with the peer via the
    peer wire protocol.

    To do so, it needs to maintain a bunch of objects. This includes:
    - the data being downloaded (see [File.t] and [Piece.t])
    - the [Peers.t] 
    - persistent data [Pers.t] *)
