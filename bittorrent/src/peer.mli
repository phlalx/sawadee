(** Worker thread to communicate with a remote peer. 

    This module implements a "worker thread" that communicates with a remote 
    peer, and controlled by a "master" [Swarm.t].

    A [Peer.t] communicates with [Swarm.t] in two ways.
    - non blocking function calls (e.g. requesting a piece, or sending a
    bitfield.  
    - by notifying it with events on a pipe.

    All [Peer.t] in a swarm and their controling [Swarm.t] eventually share a
    [Network_file.t]. This let them answer block queries from
    remote peers with no interaction with [Swarm.t]. *)
