(** A [Pfile.t] represents a file on the file system and a segment of the file.

    A file can be partitionned into several such [PFile.t] sharing the same fd.
    Each [Piece.t] will reference a list of pfiles that it'll use for read/write
    to/from the disk.

    Network file :  | - piece 1 - | - piece 2 - | ......... | - piece n - |
                    | pfile |       pfile         | pf | pf |  pf |   pf  |


    pfiles are opened to the right size using [create], exactly one pfile per 
    file specified by the torrent. Then they are split along a piece size into 
    an array. This array will be used when we initialize pieces.

    pfiles are created and pieces are initialized in [File.create].
